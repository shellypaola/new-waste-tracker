## Notification Strategy Summary

### **FINAL HYBRID APPROACH:**

**Push Notifications:**
1. ‚úÖ Daily expiry alert (7:00 AM) - CRITICAL, always on
2. ‚úÖ Weekly summary (Sunday 9:00 AM) - Optional
3. üîî First achievement ever - One-time
4. üîî Level up - Rare (1-2x/month)
5. üîî Challenge completed - Earned (1-2x/month)
6. üîî Major streak milestones - 7, 30, 100 days only

**In-App Only:**
- Regular achievement unlocks
- Challenge progress (25%, 50%, 75%)
- Daily streak updates
- Point notifications

**Expected Frequency:**
- Expiry alerts: Daily (1x/day)
- Gamification push: 3-7 per month (very low)
- In-app: As earned (user checks when convenient)

**Why Hybrid Works:**
- Major moments get immediate celebration (push)
- Regular updates don't spam (in-app)
- User has full control (can disable all gamification push)
- Balances engagement with respect
- Industry best practice for productivity + gamification apps
